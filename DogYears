Dog Years
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it!

// My age in a variable, I'm 30!
let myAge = 30;

//The first 2 years of a dogs life count as 10.5 years!
let earlyYears = 2;
earlyYears = earlyYears * 10.5;

//Later years count as 4 
let laterYears = myAge - 2;
laterYears = laterYears * 4; 

//Calculating my age in dog years...
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

//My name
let myName = ('Trevor'.toLowerCase());
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years!`)
